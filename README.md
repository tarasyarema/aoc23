# Advent of Code 2023

> `:3`

The question is, will I be able to finish it?

If I manage to finish at least 15 days, it would be
a great achivement tbh :D

## Why

This year will try to do it in Rust, and will try do it
in the most idomatic way possible xd.

## How

There's a tiny script to generate new days

```bash
sh gen.sh {day}
```

will generate a folder at `/{day}`, `cargo init`
and copy the `template.rs` as the `main.rs`.

After that, go and run `cargo run` *bb*.
